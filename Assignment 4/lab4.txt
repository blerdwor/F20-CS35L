[touch .hidden notHidden]
[ls -aA]
I tested the bug with this command and it outputted . and ..

[/usr/bin/ls --version]
I checked the version and it was 8.22

[gpg --verify --keyring ./gnu-keyring.gpg coreutils-8.29.tar.xz.sig]
First, I downloaded the 3 files (keyring, signature, and tarball) and 
then transferred them to SEASnet with WinSCP. I used this command to 
check the signature, and it outputted who the signatures were from. There 
were no errors but there was a warning that the key was not certified.
Output:
gpg: Signature made Wed 27 Dec 2017 10:29:05 AM PST using RSA key ID 306037D9
gpg: Good signature from "Pádraig Brady <P@draigBrady.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pbrady@redhat.com>"
gpg:                 aka "Pádraig Brady <pixelbeat@gnu.org>"
gpg: WARNING: This key is not certified with a trusted signature!
gpg:          There is no indication that the signature belongs to the owner.

[tar xfJ coreutils-8.29.tar.xz]
This compiled the coreutils file and created a new directory called
coreutils-8.29 with all of its content.

[cd coreutils-8.29]
[cat INSTALL]
I went into the directory and read the installation manual. It gave
instructions for how to install the coreutils and modify the command
so that it will download into a file.

[cd ..]
[mkdir coreutils]
[cd coreutils-8.29]
[./configure --prefix=/u/cs/ugrad/belle/CS35L/Week4/coreutils && make
 && make install]
I made a directory to save the file into and the [--prefix] allows me to change
where I store the file. This outputted a lot of installation messages and took
a couple of minutes.

[cd ..]
[coreutils/bin/ls -aA]
[coreutils/bin/ls -Aa]
The coreutils before the patch still outputs . and .. along with the other
files. Both of the commands output . and .. regardless of the order of the 
option.

[mv 0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch coreutils-8.29]
[cd coreutils-8.29]
[patch -p1 < 0001-ls-A-now-overrides-a.patch]
I moved the patch file into the directory with the ls command so that I could
apply the patch file using the 3rd command above.

Output:

[make]
This resulted in an error:
cd . && /bin/sh /u/cs/ugrad/belle/CS35L/Week4/coreutils-8.29/build-aux/missing

WARNING: 'automake-1.15' is missing on your system.
         You should only need it if you modified 'Makefile.am' or
         'configure.ac' or m4 files included by 'configure.ac'.
         The 'automake' program is part of the GNU Automake package:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake>
         It also requires GNU Autoconf, GNU m4 and Perl in order to run:
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf>
         <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
         <http://www.perl.org/>
make: *** [Makefile:5997: Makefile.in] Error 127

[autoreconf -fi]
I used this command as per the lab hints to resolve the error.

[make]
Then I tried this command again, and it outputted many checking messages.
It also took a couple of minutes to process the entire thing.

[src/ls -Aa]
[src/ls -aA]
The first command outputted the . and .. files, but the second one didn't.
The patch worked because now the order of the flags can override each other.
