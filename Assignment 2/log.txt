Part 1:
lnxsrv06=client, lnxsrv09=server

[ssh-keygen]
I used this to generate a new key and passphrase.

[ssh-copy-id belle@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu]
When prompted,I typed in my SEAS password.

[ssh belle@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu]
Again, I typed in my passphrase when prompted.

[C-d]
I quit that session and went back to lnxsrv06.

[eval "$(ssh-agent)"]
I used this command to start the ssh-agent.


[ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_rsa]
Then I did this command to save the key and entered passphrase when prompted.
After that, I was able to ssh into lnxsrv09 without a password.

Part 2:

First, I downloaded Xming onto my laptop.
On PuTTY, I loaded the SEASnet server and went to SSH. 
Then I went to X11 and enabled X11 forwarding and MIT-MagicCookie-1.
Then, I started the server and signed in.

[xeyes] 
This command displayed eyes in a new window.

[ssh -X belle@lnxsrv09@seas.ucla.edu] and [xeyes] 
This enabled me to use [xeyes] successfully on server 9. 

Part 3:

[ssh -AX belle@lnxsrv09.seas.ucla.edu]
[ssh -AX belle@lnxsrv07.seas.ucla.edu]
I hopped from server 6 to 9 to 7.
To enable graphics display, I used the [-X] flag.
I also used the [-A] flag to enable agent forwarding which allowed me to hop to server 7.
I could've excluded the [-X] flag but then I wouldn't be able to display graphics on server 7.
