2. [cd diffutils]
   [git checkout v3.0 -b quote]
I went to the original repository that I had cloned and then checked out a new
branch called "quote".

Output:
Switched to a new branch 'quote'

3. [patch -p1 < ../patch-3.0-quote.txt]
Then I used this command to patch the files.

Output:
patching file src/cmp.c
patching file src/diff.c
patching file src/diff3.c
patching file src/dir.c
patching file src/sdiff.c
patching file src/util.c

4. I learned how to use the add-change-log-entry-other-window function by
reading the page on gnu.org.

5. [e m a c s SP <filename>]
   [C-x 4 a]
   [changed accents ` to apostrophes ' in all strings except comments.]
   [C-x C-s]
   [C-x C-c]

<filename> refers to every file that was patched in the output above. Once I
opened the file in Emacs, I used the command to open the ChangeLog and edit it.
The comment I added for all of them is in the 3rd line. Then I saved the file
and closed Emacs.

6. [git add .]
   [git commit -F ChangeLog]
Then I used these command to add the modified files to the staging area and 
then committed them with the ChangeLog as the commit message.

7. [git format-patch -1 --stdout > formatted-patch.txt]
Next, I used this command to generate a patch file. It was created 
successfully, and should work without needing to make a lot of manual changes.

8. [cd ../]
   [git clone ~eggert/src/gnu/diffutils HWdiffutils]
   [cd HWdiffutils]
   [git checkout v3.0 -b patchery]

Output: 
Switched to a new branch 'patchery'

   [git am ../diffutils/formatted-patch.txt]
To verify the patch, I cloned the original repository into another one in my
directory and checked out the version 3.0 into a new branch. Then I applied the
patch I made earlier by using git am.

   [./bootstrap]
   [wget 'https://web.cs.ucla.edu/classes/fall20/cs35L/assign/diffutils-gets.diff']
   [patch -p0 < diffutils-gets.diff]
   [./configure]
   [make]
   [make check]
Lastly, I build this system by using the same commands as from the lab. [make]
failed again so I needed to reapply the patch. After that, [make] worked but 
[make check] still fails.

   [./src/diff . -]
   [./src/diff --help]
Since [make check] failed, I manually checked the outputs of the two commands
from the lab and the output contained no accents. So the patch worked.

9. [make distdir]
   [ls -la]
   [cd diffutils-3.0.1-d146]
   [ls -la]
   [cat ChangeLog]
After the first command, I used ls to see what new files had been created and
there was one called diffutils-3.0.1-d146. So I went to that directory and
listed the files inside. After inspecting the Changelog, I found that my entry
was at the beginning so my ChangeLog entry worked.

9. [cd ~eggert/src/gnu/emacs-CS-35L]
   [gitk]
I opened Xming to make sure it was running in the background. Then I used gitk
to see the gui version. My view of the mergepoint looks like this:

| |

Paul Eggert had made a commit after Joakim and Dmitry Gutov had made one
before. As for roles, the top window has a history of the merges and commits.
It shows a tree with the date, authors, and short description. Then the bottom
left window shows the commit message, ChangeLog entry, and detailed information
about the merge or commit. The bottom right corner is reserved for comments.
